Toony Colors Pro, version 2.6
2020/11/12
© 2020 - Jean Moreno
=============================

QUICK START
-----------
Select one of the following shader in your Material:
- Toony Colors Pro 2/Desktop
- Toony Colors Pro 2/Mobile
- Toony Colors Pro 2/Standard PBS
- Toony Colors Pro 2/Standard PBS (Specular)
Then select the features you want to enable (bump, specular, rim...), and the correct shader will automatically
be selected for you.

If using the Lightweight/Universal Render Pipeline, you will have to generate your own shaders using the Shader Generator 2.
You can also extract the LWRP Cat demo scene from the "Cat Demo LWRP.unitypackage" file.

Read the documentation for more information.

PLEASE LEAVE A REVIEW OR RATE THE PACKAGE IF YOU FIND IT USEFUL!
Enjoy! :)
